Project Aaron,Abraham,Weijian

When uploading you work implement a gitignore file in the root directory of the project. So that all the assests don`t get uploaded very important or it could mess up the project.

Also check for the smart merge link which was sent by the professor so that it could prevent scene corruption and etc. Not sure whether i am using LFS right, wether it should be placed in the project folder
